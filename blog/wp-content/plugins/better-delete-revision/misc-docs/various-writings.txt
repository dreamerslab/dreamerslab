Description:

Better Delete Revision is based on the old "Delete Revision" plugin
but it is compatible with the latest version of Wordpress (3.0.1) with improved
features. It not only deletes redundant revisions of posts from your Wordpress
Database, it also deletes other database content related to each revision such
meta information, tags, relationships, and more. Your current published,
scheduled, and draft posts are never touched by this plugin! This plugin can
also perform optimizations on your Wordpress database. With optimization and old
revision removal this plugin will keep your database lighter and smaller
throughout use. Removing old revisions and database optimizations is one of the
best things you can do to your Wordpress blog to keep it running as fast as it
can.

Post Revisions are a feature introduced in Wordpress 2.6. Whenever you or
Wordpress saves a post or a page, a revision is automatically created and stored
in your Wordpress database. Each additional revision will slowly increase the
size of your database. If you save a post or page multiple times, your number of
revisions will greatly increase overtime. For example, if you have 100 posts and
each post has 10 revisions you could be storing up to 1,000 copies of older
data! The Better Delete Revision plugin is your #1 choice to quickly and easily
removing revision from your Wordpress database. Try it out today to see what a
lighter and smaller Wordpress database can do for you!
