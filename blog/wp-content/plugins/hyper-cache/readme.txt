Hyper Cache is flexible and easy to configure cache system for WordPress.

== Description ==

Hyper Cache is a new cache system for WordPress, specifically written for
people which have their blogs on low resources hosting provider 
(cpu and mysql). It works even with hosting based on Microsoft IIS (just tuning
the configuration). It has three invalidation method: all the cache, single post
based and nothing but with control on home and archive pages invalidation.

It has not yet tested for multisite configuration (WordPress 3.0 feature).

Some features:

* compatible with the plugin wp-pda which enables a blog to be *accessible from mobile devices*
* manages (both) *plain and gzip compressed pages*
* autoclean system to reduce the disk usage
* 404 caching
* redirects caching
* easy to configure
* Global Translator compatibility
* Last Modified http header compatibility with 304 responses
* compressed storage to reduce the disk space usage
* agents, urls and cookies based rejection configurable
* easy to integrated with other plugins
