Older versions of jQuery have trouble finding the width/height of invisible DOM elements.

Therefore with heavy frontend applications your code is easy to have nested callbacks.

<p>With jQuery Queue plugin you can add functions in a queue <strong>outside</strong> the function scope;
excute the queued functions later.
It makes your code easily to be more modularize. It is a must have if you write heavy frontend websites.

Later on I found out I don\'t need all the features it has and I want it to be
easiler to customize. So I write my own simpler version called MSG.
It can only block the whole window, it has theme suuport, afterBlock and beforeUnblock
event, ... etc. It\'s only 4 kb uncompressed with code comments. Check details on

There are already a lot of
<a href="http://bit.ly/en8GYD" title="Search date picker on google">date picker plugins</a>
already, so why bother making another one? The problem is I found none of them fits my need.
Some of them is useless, you have to click for a hundred times to get the actual year you need.
Others do the trick but their layouts are not pretty enough.
At the end I end up with rolling my own version of date picker.</p>
<p>This plugin is a roller style date picker.
I found it is more useful and prettier in most of the case.
Please see a demo and tell me how you like it :)</p>';
